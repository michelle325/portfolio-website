# CS 601 Final Project
For the final project, I created a responsive porfolio website with React, Typescript, and CSS Flexbox featuring 5 pages: Home, About, Experience, Hobby, and Contact.

Photos are styled to get larger when hovered over including my home page profile picture being clickable to hyperlink to my Linkedin profile. The navigation bar is styled to remain at the top with interactive buttons on hover. Furthermore, all pages except for the home page have unique URLs. Each page has styling for ease of reading and uniformity. The contact page includes a form with a confirmation upon submission and checks for any missing fields. The footer is styled with a Linkedin icon and navigates to my Linkedin profile when clicked. 

### Due to peer dependency issues when using create-react-app for React 19, yarn was used instead of npm. Please note the changes below:


### First install yarn globally if you haven't already
npm install --global yarn

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
