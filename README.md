# CS 601 Final Project
For the final project, I created a responsive porfolio website with React, Typescript, and CSS Flexbox featuring 5 pages: Home, About, Experience, Hobby, and Contact.

The navigation bar is styled to remain at the top of the screen with interactive hover effects. All pages except for Home have unique URLs.Photos are styled with hover effects including my home page profile picture that is clickable to my Linkedin profile. Each page has styling for ease of reading and uniformity. The contact page includes confirmation upon submission and validates for any missing fields in the form. The footer is styled with a Linkedin icon and navigates to my Linkedin profile when clicked.

### Due to peer dependency issues when using create-react-app for React 19, yarn was used instead of npm. Please note the changes below:


First install yarn globally if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

To start the site, run

```bash
yarn start
```
